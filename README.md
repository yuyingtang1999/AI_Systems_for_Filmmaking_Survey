# Algorithm behind the Lens

An interactive showcase of Yuying Tang's PQE survey, **"AI Systems for Filmmaking: A Survey of HCI Research from a Labor-Centered Perspective."** Built with **Next.js 15 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS v4**. Nothing is hardcoded to a local machine — clone it anywhere, install, and run.

## What's inside

A single scrollytelling page that walks through the research:

- **Hero** — the framing question, "Who is really making the film?"
- **Framework** — the three-layer taxonomy (Labor Sites → Labor Types → Human–AI Allocation).
- **Layer 1 · Labor Sites** — an interactive ATL/BTL × Individual/Group matrix.
- **Layer 2 · Labor Types** — a 2021→2025 timeline showing AI's spread across labor types.
- **Layer 3 · Allocation** — human-vs-AI control per labor type.
- **Synthesis** — a Sankey-style flow from sites to types to allocation.
- **The Archive** — a filterable explorer of all 31 systems; click any card to open its paper (DOI).
- **Conclusion** — three takeaways and a CSV download of the corpus.

The full dataset (31 papers, coded by site / type / allocation, with DOI links) lives in `lib/data.ts` and is also downloadable at `public/ai-filmmaking-corpus.csv`. The palette is taken directly from the PQE deck's gradient scheme.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **18.18 or newer** (Node 20+ recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node)

Check your version:

```bash
node -v
```

## Run locally (VS Code)

1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Open a terminal (`` Ctrl+` `` / `` Cmd+` ``) — make sure it's in the project root (the folder containing `package.json`).
3. Install dependencies (first time only):

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser. The page hot-reloads as you edit files.

## Run from a fresh clone (any machine)

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd "UROP webbuild"
npm install
npm run dev
```

Because dependencies are declared in `package.json` and paths are relative, this works identically on any OS with Node installed. `node_modules` and `.next` are git-ignored, so each machine builds its own.

## Available scripts

| Command         | What it does                                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`   | Start the development server on port 3000           |
| `npm run build` | Create an optimized production build                |
| `npm run start` | Serve the production build (run `build` first)      |
| `npm run lint`  | Run ESLint                                          |

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This project is configured for a **static export** (`output: "export"` in
`next.config.mjs`), so `npm run build` writes a complete static site — including
`index.html` — to the `out/` folder. No server is required.

### Option A — automatic (recommended)

A GitHub Actions workflow is included at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository (default branch `main`).
2. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source** and
   choose **GitHub Actions**.
3. Every push to `main` builds the site and publishes it. Your page will be at
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

The workflow's *Setup Pages* step automatically sets the correct base path for a
project page, so all assets resolve.

### Option B — build locally and publish the `out/` folder

```bash
npm ci
npm run build          # generates ./out/index.html + assets
```

Then serve `out/` however you like — e.g. push its contents to a `gh-pages`
branch, or drag it into any static host (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, S3).
A `.nojekyll` file is included so GitHub Pages serves the `_next/` assets.

To preview the exported site locally:

```bash
npx serve out
```

## Deploy to Vercel (alternative)

1. Push this folder to a Git repository.
2. Import it at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new) — Next.js is
   auto-detected. (Static export also works on Vercel unchanged.)

Page content is composed in `app/page.tsx`; the research data all lives in `lib/data.ts`.

> **Note on `npm install`:** dependencies include a platform-specific compiler binary (Next.js SWC). `npm install` fetches the right one for whatever OS you clone onto, so the project stays fully portable across macOS, Linux, and Windows.
